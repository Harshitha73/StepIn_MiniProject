# Introduction:

 Sorting the given elements using the Sorting Algorithms in C. A Soring Algorithm is an efficient way to perform the task that puts elements of a list in a certain order or arrange them into a particular order. Sorting data has been developed to arrange the array values in various ways for a database.

# Research:
 
 The Sorting Algorithms available are:
  1.Bubble Sort.
  
  2.Insertion Sort.
  
  3.Selection Sort.
  
  4.Quick Sort.
  
  5.Merge Sort. etc..
   
  These Algorithms are classified based on their efficiency, their time complexity, 
  memory usage and other such factors -

# Cost and Features:
  
   The only cost of the implementation of Sorting Algorithms is the memory usage and the time taken by the code execution, also known as Space Complexity and Time Complexity.

# Defining the System:

  The System consists some of the various techniques available for Sorting a given list of elements. While each of the algorithms have a different methodolgy in sorting, the below flowwchart gives the basic idea on how the elements are sorted.

   ## WHO:  
   The Sorting Algorithms are used by almost everyone for various applications, like in searching applications, sorting the data in a database.

   ## WHAT: 
   The Sorting Algorithms are the techniques that are used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.
  
   ## WHEN: 
   The Sorting techniques are used to arrange elements of any list and in divide and conquer methods, and when a problem needs to be optimize,i.e., reduce the complexity of the problem. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists.   

   ## WHERE: 
   These algorithms are used mostly in datastructure algorithms, numerical and lexical arranging problems, database algorithms and searching algorithms.

   ## HOW: 
   Sorting techniques generally arrange the elements of the list either in ascending or descending order. The algorithms based on the methodoly uses a comparision operator, or divide and conquer methodoly etc.
